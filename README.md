### Step 2: Find Your Steam ID

1. Visit [SteamID Finder](https://steamidfinder.com/)

## Usage

### Main Interface

- **Status Tab**: View your current Steam status and overall gaming statistics
- **Games Tab**: Browse your recently played games and launch them directly
- **Settings Tab**: Configure API settings and display preferences

### Features

- **Auto-refresh**: The application automatically updates your data based on the configured interval
- **Manual refresh**: Click "Update Now" to immediately fetch the latest data
- **Game launching**: Double-click any game in the "Games" tab to open it in Steam
- **Always on top**: The window stays on top of other applications for easy monitoring

### Status Bar

The bottom status bar shows:
- "Ready" when the application is idle
- "Fetching Steam data..." when updating
- "Last updated: HH:MM:SS" after successful updates
- Error messages if something goes wrong

## Configuration

The application stores its configuration in `steam_status_config.ini`. You can edit this file directly if needed:

```ini
[Steam]
steam_api_key = your_api_key_here
steam_id = your_steam_id_here
update_interval = 300
show_achievements = True
max_recent_games = 5
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Error getting owned games"**
   - Check that your API key is correct
   - Verify your Steam ID is the correct 64-bit format
   - Ensure your Steam profile is public

2. **"No data displaying"**
   - Make sure you've entered both API key and Steam ID
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify your Steam profile privacy settings

3. **"Games not launching"**
   - Ensure Steam is installed and running
   - Check that the Steam browser protocol is enabled

### Steam Profile Privacy

For the application to work properly, your Steam profile must be set to "Public" or "Friends Only" with game details visible. To check this:

1. Go to your Steam profile
2. Click "Edit Profile"
3. Go to "Privacy Settings"
4. Set "Game details" to "Public" or "Friends Only"

## API Rate Limits

The Steam Web API has rate limits. The application is designed to:
- Cache data to minimize API calls
- Use reasonable default update intervals (5 minutes)
- Handle rate limiting gracefully

## Privacy & Security

- Your API key is stored locally on your computer
- The application only makes requests to official Steam API endpoints
- No personal data is transmitted to third parties
- API key is masked in the settings interface

## Platform Support

This application is cross-platform and works on:
- Windows 10/11
- macOS 10.14+
- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)

## Dependencies

- `requests`: For HTTP API calls to Steam
