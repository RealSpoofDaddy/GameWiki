                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> is a 2017 action-adventure game developed and published by <a href="#nintendo">Nintendo</a> for the <a href="#nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="#wii-u">Wii U</a> consoles. It is the nineteenth installment in <a href="#the-legend-of-zelda-series">The Legend of Zelda series</a> and is set at the end of the Zelda timeline.</p>

                        <p>The player controls <a href="#link">Link</a>, who awakens from a hundred-year slumber to a mysterious voice that guides him to defeat <a href="#calamity-ganon">Calamity Ganon</a> before he can completely destroy the kingdom of <a href="#hyrule">Hyrule</a>. The game is set in an open world where players are encouraged to explore and experiment with the environment.</p>

                        <p>Breath of the Wild received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers calling it a masterpiece. The game won numerous awards and is often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. It was praised for its open-ended gameplay, innovative physics engine, and departure from the traditional Zelda formula.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="gameplay">
                        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                        <p>Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas, scant <a href="#tutorial">instruction</a> given to the player, and encouragement to explore and experiment. Players are free to explore the world and approach objectives in any order they choose.</p>

                        <h3 id="exploration">Exploration</h3>
                        <p>The game features an enormous open world, larger than any previous entry in the series. Players can climb virtually any surface, including mountains, trees, and buildings. The world is filled with various landmarks, settlements, and over 100 <a href="#shrine">Shrines</a> that contain puzzles and challenges.</p>

                        <p>The game implements a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle that affects gameplay. Rain makes surfaces slippery and can extinguish fires, while lightning strikes metal objects during thunderstorms. Cold environments require warm clothing or food, while hot areas can cause Link to lose health without proper protection.</p>

                        <h3 id="combat">Combat</h3>
                        <p>Combat in Breath of the Wild emphasizes creative problem-solving. Players can use the environment to their advantage, such as rolling boulders onto enemies, using metal objects as conductors during thunderstorms, or setting grass fires to create updrafts for the paraglider.</p>

                        <p>Weapons and shields have limited durability and will break after extended use, forcing players to constantly acquire new equipment. This system encourages experimentation with different weapon types and combat strategies.</p>

                        <h3 id="physics">Physics System</h3>
                        <p>The game features a sophisticated physics engine that allows for emergent gameplay. Objects behave realistically, with proper weight, momentum, and interaction with elements like fire, water, and electricity. This system enables creative solutions to puzzles and combat encounters.</p>

                    <section id="development">
                        <h2>Development</h2>
                        <p>Development of Breath of the Wild began in 2013, immediately after the completion of <a href="#the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</a>. The game was directed by <a href="#hidemaro-fujibayashi">Hidemaro Fujibayashi</a> and produced by series creator <a href="#shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> and <a href="#eiji-aonuma">Eiji Aonuma</a>.</p>

                        <p>The development team aimed to "re-think the conventions of Zelda" and return to the series' roots of exploration and discovery. They were inspired by the original 1986 <a href="#the-legend-of-zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>, which encouraged players to explore and experiment.</p>

                        <p>The physics engine was developed specifically for this game and took several years to perfect. The team wanted to create a world where "chemistry" between different elements would create unexpected and interesting interactions.</p>

                    <section id="reception">
                        <h2>Reception</h2>
                        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild received universal critical acclaim upon release. It holds perfect scores from numerous gaming publications and has a Metacritic score of 97/100 for the Nintendo Switch version.</p>

                        <p>Critics praised the game's open-world design, exploration mechanics, and departure from traditional Zelda conventions. The physics engine and emergent gameplay were particularly well-received, with many reviewers noting the game's ability to surprise and delight players through unexpected interactions.</p>

                        <p>The game was a commercial success, selling over 30 million copies worldwide as of 2023, making it the best-selling Zelda game of all time. It served as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch and was credited with helping the console achieve strong initial sales.</p>

                    <section id="legacy">
                        <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
                        <p>Breath of the Wild's influence on the gaming industry has been significant. Its approach to open-world design, where players are given tools and systems rather than scripted sequences, has inspired numerous other games.</p>

                        <p>The game's success led to the development of a direct sequel, <a href="#the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, released in 2023. The sequel expanded upon the original's mechanics while introducing new gameplay elements such as building and crafting systems.</p>

                        <p>The game is frequently studied in game development circles for its design philosophy and technical achievements. Its "multiplication through subtraction" approach, where removing traditional game elements led to more creative gameplay, has become a model for modern game design.</p>
